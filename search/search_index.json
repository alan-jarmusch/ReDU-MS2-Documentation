This tools allows the user to reanalyze the public data via custom library search parameters. The  library search results  are displayed on GNPS which includes the option of downloading a table with every chemical annotation versus the files it was detected in (cells of the matrix reflect detected, 1, or not detected, 0). Further documentation on GNPS library search is located  here .  Chemical annotation is performed in  GNPS  by comparing MS2 spectra, specifically product ion spectra, with reference MS2 fragmentation patterns (GNPS integrates of the majority of public reference MS2 spectra library). GNPS annotations via spectral reference matching are considered level 2 (putative annotation based on spectral library similarity) or 3 (putatively characterized compound class based on spectral similarity to known compounds of a chemical class) by the 2007 metabolomics standard initiative  PMID: 24039616 .",
