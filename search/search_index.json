The file selector allows one to select (and filter) files based on the sample information provided with every file, and place multiple types of files into one of 6 different groups (\ni.e.\n G1-G6). A single button click on \"Set up GNPS Networking\" loads all the files and launches a GNPS molecular job; an email will be sent when the job has finished.

The \nlibrary search results\n are displayed on GNPS which includes the option of downloading a table with every chemical annotation versus the files it was detected in (cells of the matrix reflect detected, 1, or not detected, 0).

The results are used in the \nChemical Enrichment Analysis\n as well as \nSample Information Enrichment Analysis\n.

Further documentation on GNPS library search is located \nhere\n.\n\n\nChemical annotation is performed in \nGNPS\n by comparing MS2 spectra, specifically product ion spectra, with reference MS2 fragmentation patterns (GNPS integrates of the majority of public reference MS2 spectra library). GNPS annotations via spectral reference matching are considered level 2 (putative annotation based on spectral library similarity) or 3 (putatively characterized compound class based on spectral similarity to known compounds of a chemical class) by the 2007 metabolomics standard initiative \nPMID: 24039616\n.\n\n\nTutorial\n\n\n\n\nLog into a \nGNPS\n account.\n\n\nNavigate to the \nReDU-MS2\n homepage.\n\n\nClick on the \n\"Select Data to Reanalyze at GNPS\"\n text.\n\n\n\n\nIMAGE\n\n\n\n\nSelect the files you wish to include in the reanalysis by clicking the \nGroup 1 (G1)\n button.\n\n\nThe orange buttons in the center of the screen correspond to Sample Information categories.\n\n\n\n\nIMAGE\n\n\n\n\nIf filter/s are used, they will appear as red box/boxes in the Attribute Filters Panel (upper-right corner) of the page.
