# Welcome to the Reanalysis of Data User Interface for MS2 (ReDU-MS2)

[ReDU-MS2](http://dorresteinappshub.ucsd.edu:5005/) is a web-based user interface that can be used to easily **Analyze Your Data** or **Analyze Public Data** mass spectrometry data, specifically MS2 (aka tandem mass spectrometry, MS<sup>2</sup>, MS/MS) data. The user interface allows one to select public mass spectrometry files in [MassIVE](https://massive.ucsd.edu/ProteoSAFe/static/massive.jsp), a public mass spectrometry data repository, based on a curated set of sample information and launch reanalyses in the Global Natural Products Social Molecular Networking [GNPS](https://gnps.ucsd.edu/ProteoSAFe/static/gnps-splash2.jsp) platform.

MS2 data, specifically product ion scans, are obtained from user-submitted open-source data files (.mzXML) and analyzed *de novo* using molecular networking and chemical annotations within GNPS.

This is a community effort and everyone is encouraged to participate by submitting their own data and sample information ([instructions](HowtoContribute.md)).

We are developing two main branches of functionality:

## Analyze Your Data
  * [Multivariate Comparisons](AnalyzeYourData_MultivariateComparisons.md) - Multivariate Comparison of Your MS2 Annotations with Public Data
  * [Select Data to Co-Analyze at GNPS](AnalyzeYourData_CoAnalysis_at_GNPS.md) - Select cohorts of data chosen by sample information to co-analyze with your data: Molecular Networking at GNPS, Library Search at GNPS, Chemical Enrichment Analysis, and Sample Information Enrichment Analysis

## Analyze Public Data
  * [Multivariate Comparisons](AnalyzePublicData_MultivariateComparisons.md) - Multivariate Analysis of MS2 Annotations
  * [Chemical Enrichment Analysis](AnalyzePublicData_ChemicalEnrichment.md) - Explore where chemicals occur in public data
  * [Select Data Re-Analyze at GNPS](PublicData_Reanalysis_at_GNPS.md)  - Select cohorts of data chosen by sample information to reanalyze by: Molecular Networking at GNPS, Library Search at GNPS, Chemical Enrichment Analysis, and Sample Information Enrichment Analysis
