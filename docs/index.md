# Welcome to the Reanalysis of Data User Interface for MS2 (ReDU-MS2)

[ReDU-MS2](http://dorresteinappshub.ucsd.edu:5005/) is a web-based user interface that can be used to easily **Analyze Your Data** or **Analyze All Public Data**. The user interface allows one to select public mass spectrometry files in [MassIVE](https://massive.ucsd.edu/ProteoSAFe/static/massive.jsp), a public mass spectrometry data repository, based on a curated set of sample information and launch reanalyses in the Global Natural Products Social Molecular Networking [GNPS](https://gnps.ucsd.edu/ProteoSAFe/static/gnps-splash2.jsp) platform. 

MS2 data (aka tandem mass spectrometry, MS^2, MS/MS), specifically product ion scans, are obtained from user-submitted open-source data files (.mzXML) and analyzed *de novo* using molecular networking and chemical annotations within GNPS.

This is a community effort and everyone is encouraged to participate by submitting their own data and sample information ([instructions](HowtoContribute.md)).

We are developing two main branches of functionality:

* **Analyze Your Data**
  * [Multivariate Comparison of Your MS2 Annotations with Public Data](AnalyzeYourData_MultivariateComparisons.md)
  * [Co-Analyze your Data via GNPS Molecular Networking](AnalyzeYourData_CoAnalysis_MolecularNetworking.md)
  * [Sample Information Enhrichment Analysis](AnalyzeYourData_SampleInformationEnrichment.md)

* **Analyze All Public Data**
  * [Multivariate Analysis of MS2 Annotations](AnalyzePublicData_MultivariateComparisons.md)
  * [Reanalyze Public Data via GNPS Molecular Networking](AnalyzePublicData_MolecularNetworking.md)
  * [Chemical Annotation Enrichment Analysis](AnalyzePublicData_ChemicalEnrichment.md)
  * [Sample Information Enhrichment Analysis](AnalyzePublicData_SampleInformationEnrichment.md)
